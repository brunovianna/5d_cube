    -The Perichorein is point where the universe began according to ancient Greeks. It \
    is a place where all things are present sharing the same space and time without \
    loosing its own characteristics. In medieval times the church used it to solve the \
    conflict of “many souls vs one soul” (a clear influence of shamanism in christianity) \

    ["5 dimensions","Five dimensions is difficult to visualise since each time a dimension is observed \
    from another it implies a projection or necessary deformation toll to adjust to specific set of \
    conditions required. For example if we would like to imagine a 4d cube we have to imagine a 3d cube \
    with a \“smaller\” nested cube supported by each of its insides by other cubes, but all of them are \
    the same size occupying the same space at the same time.<br/>\
    If we see this cubes in different moments occupying the same time (with animated sequence) if \
    possible to glimpse through movement the actual nature of the immobile object. Sometimes 4d \
    is referred as “time” which is not accurate but only through a time projection we are able to \
    access.<br/>\
    A 5d cube is a 4d projected to another 4d cube supported by other 4d cube. Sometimes 5d is \
    introduced as “intensity” “concentration” or “density” since on higher dimensions space widens \
    inside objects, creating an apparent effect of folding in themselves."], //46

    set being examined. Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and \
    testing, for each sample point c, whether the sequence \
    f c ( 0 ) , f c ( f c ( 0 ) ) , ,f_{c}(f_{c}(0))...  goes to infinity.<br/>\

    achieve the higher number of seeds possible. Paradoxically the best configuration is a place \
    where it is difficult to recognise spoke since two spokes are intertwined.<br/>\

    ["Helicoid","It is the only ruled minimal surface other than the plane.<br/>\
    Since it is considered that the planar range extends through negative and positive infinity, close \
    observation shows the appearance of two parallel or mirror planes in the sense that if the slope \
    of one plane is traced, the co-plane can be seen to be bypassed or skipped \
    Conversely, a plane can be turned into a helicoid by choosing a line, or axis, on the plane, then \
    twisting the plane around that axis.<br/>\
    <br/>\
    It is a body that shifts axis through continue movement jumping from dancer to the partner and \

    world they allow direct communication with gods through oracles and signs. It can be understood as \
    the vanishing point of cosmic perspective."], //56
    ["Myth","The myth is a form of pure attraction because it has no substance. The myth usually signals \
    towards the origins of something without solving any form, which means that it turns into pure \
    desire energy voided of any meaning. It is the promise of an explanation for the appearance of \
    something in the real. Myths are units beyond a scale that haven’t been translated, into \
    recognizable elements. They constitute phantasmagoric dimension where “inertia” interacts with \
    the real producing vacant meaning.<br/>\
    But the horizon created by this vacuum opens up an ideological space and time that displays \
    images of pathos and produce a multitude of mythologies. It is through the reaction of our \
    psyche to this unfulfilled desire that variations of things appear. Tension works as a motor of \
    visualization."], //57

    Daimons were possibly seen as the souls or tutelar sities of a collectivity.<br/>\

    symbol of their union. Eros demanded Psyche the secrecy of the night so he could hide his \

        each other to define themselves? If you what to have many one is obliged\

        image that migrates through forms and imagery in order to keep a specific\
        emotional charge through time in cultures.\

        "How to create a dynamogram? How could it help us to understand the relation\
        one and many?\
        There is a path via an Ancient Greek concept:\
        -The Perichoresis is a point where the universe began according to ancient\
        Greeks. It is where all things are present sharing the same space and time without\
        loosing its own characteristics.\
        The strategy is to reach that place but from our own. This is where representation\
        and projection plays a major roll because they are tools to visualise those\
        mechanics. In order to access that forms we have to understand some rules of\
        presentation and representation within dimensions.\
        Let’s start from our native reference.\
        In order to be have a body in three dimensions (a unit) there are three rules to\
        follow<br/>\
        -Unicity. No object or body can occupy the same space at the same time as any\
        other one.<br/>\
        -indivisibility. Each element has its own narrative line, if the body is split then is not\
        longer one entity but many<br/>\
        -Immobility. Representation of a point of view necessarily deforms the real to show\
        it as representation. An image flattens the body 3d into 2d. <br/>\
        As soon as we move\
        our sight the trick is revealed and the projection shows is deformed nature. A\
        world map is a good example of this, it presupposes an immobile omnipresent eye\
        flattening the territory and its accidents. You are able to see the entirety of globe\
        as a flat surface, something impossible in our reality.\
        Projection is the method to access inter dimensional translations.\
        So a higher dimension my allow us to bend this dimensional laws to reach other\
        forms of representations. One and many can be in the same space and time. There\
        is just one important consideration: higher dimensions are difficult to visualise since each time a\
        dimension is observed from another it implies an applied projection or necessary toll to adjust to\
        specific set of conditions required in between them.",
        "For example if we would like to imagine a 4d cube we have to imagine a 3d cube with a\
        \“smaller\” nested cube supported by each of its insides by other cubes.\
        BUT all of them of the same size. All occupying the same space at the same time.\
        If we could be able see this set of cubes in different moments occupying the same space (with\

        impossible immobile object. The external cube morphs into the inner cube and the small one\
        turns into the external one. This object moves in time allowing us different views of what\
        happens without movement. It could be understood as a collection of snapshots of all possible\
        connections through their vertices.\

        So now we have a possible endless source of energy for a visual machine. The urgent visual\
        need to represent a 4d cube real nature and the out come of that projections into ours. It is like\
        a matryoshka but with no clear external o internal figurine nevertheless morphing in perpetual\
        motion.\
        If we plan to use it as a visualizing platform machine the only limitation is its small capacity to\
        hold images. A tesseract has only 24 faces to use as tableaux.\
        A penteract or 5d cube has 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 square faces, 40 cubic cells, constructed\
        as 3 tesseracts, {4,3,3}, around each cubic ridge.\
        A 5d cube is a 4d projected to another 4d cube supported by other 4d cube. Sometimes 5d is\
        referred vaguely as a dimension which offers “concentration”, “intensity” or “density” since at\
        higher dimension, the inside space gets wider holding more elements, creating an apparent\
        effect of forms folding in themselves.<br/>\

        "Mythological machine - Iconological Machine<br/>\
        Furio Jesi proposes a gnosiological model\
        to approach the real. What he calls the “Mythological machine” pro- duces narratives,\
        and the core of which implies an inaccessible space, supposed to hide an archetypical,\
        meta-historical vision: the myth. If demanded this machine will never give the truth, but\
        only versions of it in the form of mythologies. The myth will remain as potential (with no\
        real substance) and we only can use mythologies to negotiate with the world.\
        The machine throws us automatically into a loop of infinite forms or mythological\
        versions none of which will drive us closer to the core. In this mechanism, truth is not\
        understood as something we can reach, but rather as an inaccessible answer that\
        teases us with the potential existence of a definite solution. Thus, truth is an infinite\
        series of variables of a dream, all valid, all possible.\
        This maneuver is a double hinge since it does not only fuel our desire of getting closer to\
        \“the one\” but also makes evident our understanding of truth and strategies to achieve\
        it.",
        "The western model of knowledge conceives truth as a bright shining figure. Truth\
        offers light from a single, evident source. We can even see other things and perceive our\
        surroundings using this energy and clarity. The closer we are to the source the more of\
        its essence we will receive. Like moths we are attracted to the brightness of knowledge.\
        The mythological machine proposes a different model of knowledge. It conceives truth\
        as something secret that can never be reached directly. If we want to access the core of\
        the real it will unfold through an interpretation or metaphor and never directly. It is not an\
        emission of energy but a trap of possible meanings. Behind the appearance of a figure\
        we will find always another figure (or meaning). A mask behind a mask behind a mask.\
        Truth is a tension between figures and not a precious element.\
        Truth appears black and obscure, a gravitational black hole which from time to time\
        bursts fragments of solidified imagery. It is a function to be solved like an enigma. If we\
        want to know the truth of a myth, the origin of fire by example; the machine will propose\
        a mythology."

        "Mythologies are the group of narratives that the collective body uses to communicate\
        within different parts of itself. Since memory is metaphoric energy, it is projected through\
        time to other generations, and by doing so, it delineates a body with no time or space.\
        We talk to ourselves using images, metaphors and metonymies because we are trapped\
        in time and space; we can’t prevent or recreate conditions without falling in obvious\
        contradictions or misinterpretations. We can only hold to the description of a process or\
        transformation. This methodology will not describe or give precise indications, but it will\
        provide us with warnings on how energy is distributed in different situations. \“Die toten\
        mahnen uns\” (\“The deaths urgently warn us\”) is the epitaph on Rosa Luxembourg\’s\
        gravestone. We talk in figures to adjust the narrative to a timeless circumstance.",
        "In mythology all versions are welcomed since they help to give consistency to the\
        collective narrative. There are no false or wrong mythologies only more or less intense\
        ones regarding the flux of energy. It is knowledge in which the more varied the\
        interpretation is the more anchor points of activation it may have.\
        The individual is the possibility to access this polyphonic narrative in one precise point.\
        This singular \“reading\” is limited and anchored by the unit which allows its ideological\
        framework."

        "Nachleben<br/>\
        Nachleben (afterlife) der Antike (of antiquity) is an idea that Aby\
        Warburg used to underline. It is a trace of continuity between antiquity (classical Greek\
        period) and the medieval and Renaissance culture. If sculpture and painting had\
        reached such a refined representation of human affairs and psyche, what happens to\
        those icons afterwards? Did culture reset its representation and start them all over again\
        in the Middle Ages? Could we forget the forms and emotions of the pagan culture\
        without a trace? Where did all the emotions and social intensities Aphrodite represented\
        go?",
        "The past never dies or closes in packages or periods. It migrates through images or\
        forms (Bildwanderung) into the present, but modified in a phantasmagoric dimension\
        waiting to be reactivated by historical and adequate pathos contexts. In this sense, it is\
        misleading to even think of a Renaissance (literally: new birth) since nothing was ever\
        gone. Warburg proposes to read the stories or mythologies of images across space and\
        time through different cultures, morphing and negotiating appearance in each context."

        "Iconological machine<br/>\
        I propose to read Warburg perspective as a mythological\
        machine that will produce images in the same manner as Jesi did with mythologies. We\
        can imagine a circular zoetrope where images flow one after another in an endless flux.\
        f we expand the consequences of this new “mythological image machine” and place\
        ourselves inside the carousel of versions and move along the loop of infinite images, we\
        can discover a crucial detail: all those different images could come to life animated by\
        the circular movement, like a mythological kinetoscope. Since each image and each\
        narrative recalls slightly the neighbouring ones, they will automatically produce all\
        together \“cinematic action\”. The more mysterious and obscure the myth (the more\
        mythologies we have of a myth), the more detailed and clear a movement we will get. In\
        fact, there is no need to have them in a perfect sequence, the only requirement is to\
        have the endless capability to produce the next frame (version) to complete the\
        animated sequence and make it appear.",
        "The resulting moving image is a collective body that moves through other bodies and\
        also inhabits many individual time frames. It lives in all images, in all spaces\
        simultaneously but keeps all of its individual characteristics. In light of this apparatus, we\
        can say that all bodies are photograms of the actions of the real collective body. The\
        mass never allows itself to be photographed, since it only shows self-fragmentation. In\
        order to fully grasp or understand it, we have to approach it in movement. There is no\
        \“independent organ\” or even what we call \“the individual\”, only endless versions\
        nourishing a body that lives through many generations distant in time but at once."
