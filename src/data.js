    is an abstraction. If you don’t one and two is one in the mirror so nothing but three you can say \
    that the only thing that you da from the beginning was many. The one is the methodology used to reach \

        of the extremes of a single spectrum. How to understand correspondences\

        each other to define themselves? If you what to have many one is obliged\

        Aby Warburg developed the concept of the dynamogram. We can\
        understand in a canonical way as being another definition of the\
        pathosformel (or formula of pathos) which would imply a culturally charged\
        image that migrates through forms and imagery in order to keep a specific\
        emotional charge through time in cultures.\
        But it is also possible to dare a more challenging proposition: an image so\
        crossed with connections with others, so tense with ideological discourses,\
        so charged with different forms and meaning that it starts producing other\
        images.\

        "How to create a dynamogram? How could it help us to understand the relation\
        one and many?\
        There is a path via an Ancient Greek concept:\
        -The Perichoresis is a point where the universe began according to ancient\
        Greeks. It is where all things are present sharing the same space and time without\
        loosing its own characteristics.\
        The strategy is to reach that place but from our own. This is where representation\
        and projection plays a major roll because they are tools to visualise those\
        mechanics. In order to access that forms we have to understand some rules of\
        presentation and representation within dimensions.\
        Let’s start from our native reference.\
        In order to be have a body in three dimensions (a unit) there are three rules to\
        follow<br/>\
        -Unicity. No object or body can occupy the same space at the same time as any\
        other one.<br/>\
        -indivisibility. Each element has its own narrative line, if the body is split then is not\
        longer one entity but many<br/>\
        -Immobility. Representation of a point of view necessarily deforms the real to show\
        it as representation. An image flattens the body 3d into 2d. <br/>\
        As soon as we move\
        our sight the trick is revealed and the projection shows is deformed nature. A\
        world map is a good example of this, it presupposes an immobile omnipresent eye\
        flattening the territory and its accidents. You are able to see the entirety of globe\
        as a flat surface, something impossible in our reality.\
        Projection is the method to access inter dimensional translations.\
        So a higher dimension my allow us to bend this dimensional laws to reach other\
        forms of representations. One and many can be in the same space and time. There\
        is just one important consideration: higher dimensions are difficult to visualise since each time a\
        dimension is observed from another it implies an applied projection or necessary toll to adjust to\
        specific set of conditions required in between them.",
        "For example if we would like to imagine a 4d cube we have to imagine a 3d cube with a\
        \“smaller\” nested cube supported by each of its insides by other cubes.\
        BUT all of them of the same size. All occupying the same space at the same time.\
        If we could be able see this set of cubes in different moments occupying the same space (with\
        animated sequence) it would give us a glimpse (through movement) of the actual nature of this\
        impossible immobile object. The external cube morphs into the inner cube and the small one\
        turns into the external one. This object moves in time allowing us different views of what\
        happens without movement. It could be understood as a collection of snapshots of all possible\
        connections through their vertices.\
        Sometimes 4d is referred as \“time\” which is not accurate but only through a time process we are\
        able to understand what is happening. Action without time.<br/>\
        \
        So now we have a possible endless source of energy for a visual machine. The urgent visual\
        need to represent a 4d cube real nature and the out come of that projections into ours. It is like\
        a matryoshka but with no clear external o internal figurine nevertheless morphing in perpetual\
        motion.\
        If we plan to use it as a visualizing platform machine the only limitation is its small capacity to\
        hold images. A tesseract has only 24 faces to use as tableaux.\
        A penteract or 5d cube has 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 square faces, 40 cubic cells, constructed\
        as 3 tesseracts, {4,3,3}, around each cubic ridge.\
        A 5d cube is a 4d projected to another 4d cube supported by other 4d cube. Sometimes 5d is\
        referred vaguely as a dimension which offers “concentration”, “intensity” or “density” since at\
        higher dimension, the inside space gets wider holding more elements, creating an apparent\
        effect of forms folding in themselves.<br/>\
        This dynamogram can be then a machine to understand relations among a collections of\
        images with different ways crossing the tension unit and multiplicity. A box in a box in box all\
        of them the same size in the same space at the same time."

        "Mythological machine - Iconological Machine<br/>\
        Furio Jesi proposes a gnosiological model\
        to approach the real. What he calls the “Mythological machine” pro- duces narratives,\
        and the core of which implies an inaccessible space, supposed to hide an archetypical,\
        meta-historical vision: the myth. If demanded this machine will never give the truth, but\
        only versions of it in the form of mythologies. The myth will remain as potential (with no\
        real substance) and we only can use mythologies to negotiate with the world.\
        The machine throws us automatically into a loop of infinite forms or mythological\
        versions none of which will drive us closer to the core. In this mechanism, truth is not\
        understood as something we can reach, but rather as an inaccessible answer that\
        teases us with the potential existence of a definite solution. Thus, truth is an infinite\
        series of variables of a dream, all valid, all possible.\
        This maneuver is a double hinge since it does not only fuel our desire of getting closer to\
        \“the one\” but also makes evident our understanding of truth and strategies to achieve\
        it.",
        "The western model of knowledge conceives truth as a bright shining figure. Truth\
        offers light from a single, evident source. We can even see other things and perceive our\
        surroundings using this energy and clarity. The closer we are to the source the more of\
        its essence we will receive. Like moths we are attracted to the brightness of knowledge.\
        The mythological machine proposes a different model of knowledge. It conceives truth\
        as something secret that can never be reached directly. If we want to access the core of\
        the real it will unfold through an interpretation or metaphor and never directly. It is not an\
        emission of energy but a trap of possible meanings. Behind the appearance of a figure\
        we will find always another figure (or meaning). A mask behind a mask behind a mask.\
        Truth is a tension between figures and not a precious element.\
        Truth appears black and obscure, a gravitational black hole which from time to time\
        bursts fragments of solidified imagery. It is a function to be solved like an enigma. If we\
        want to know the truth of a myth, the origin of fire by example; the machine will propose\
        a mythology."

        We talk to ourselves using images, metaphors and metonymies because we are trapped\
        in time and space; we can’t prevent or recreate conditions without falling in obvious\
        contradictions or misinterpretations. We can only hold to the description of a process or\
        transformation. This methodology will not describe or give precise indications, but it will\
        provide us with warnings on how energy is distributed in different situations. \“Die toten\

        ones regarding the flux of energy. It is knowledge in which the more varied the\

        period) and the medieval and Renaissance culture. If sculpture and painting had\
        reached such a refined representation of human affairs and psyche, what happens to\
        those icons afterwards? Did culture reset its representation and start them all over again\

        misleading to even think of a Renaissance (literally: new birth) since nothing was ever\

        the circular movement, like a mythological kinetoscope. Since each image and each\
        narrative recalls slightly the neighbouring ones, they will automatically produce all\
        together \“cinematic action\”. The more mysterious and obscure the myth (the more\
        mythologies we have of a myth), the more detailed and clear a movement we will get. In\
        fact, there is no need to have them in a perfect sequence, the only requirement is to\
        have the endless capability to produce the next frame (version) to complete the\

        also inhabits many individual time frames. It lives in all images, in all spaces\
        simultaneously but keeps all of its individual characteristics. In light of this apparatus, we\
        can say that all bodies are photograms of the actions of the real collective body. The\
        mass never allows itself to be photographed, since it only shows self-fragmentation. In\
        order to fully grasp or understand it, we have to approach it in movement. There is no\
